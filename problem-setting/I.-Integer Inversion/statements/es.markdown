*A trivial problem statement for a trivial problem, how fitting!*, you are given an integer, your only task is to print it in reverse order without any leading zeroes, meaning if you are given $2980$ you have to print $892$.

# Input
A single integer $N$ such that $1 \le N \le 10^8$.

# Output
An integer $ans$ such that it's the same as $N$ in reverse order without any leading zeroes.
