I know that the correct way to spell 'Kodemania' is, in fact, with a 'C.' However, I prefer it when problem names match their corresponding letter in the problem set, so here we are. Your task is simple: you will be given a single character of the English alphabet (either in lowercase or uppercase), and you need to print whether that character is in 'Kodemania2023'

# Input
You will be given a single English character on a line.

# Output

Output on a single line:

 - *YES* if the given character is in 'Kodemania2023'.
 - *NO* otherwise.
